# FSD 4.0

## History

This repository is derived from the last known public copy of 
Marty Bochane's FSD 2 source code.

It originated from a zip file 'fsd1110.zip', which bears indications it may
have been "FSFDT Windows FSD Beta from FSD V3.000 draft 9".
It is almost identical to contents of the fsd-ubuntu-120413.tar.bz2 distribution
still available from the Apollo3 flight simulator site.

## License

No license was included with the source code, nor copyright claim.

The sources are assumed to be available under the public domain.

Unfortunately, as an Australian, any modifications I make on this code are
automatically copyrighted, and as such, I release my modifications under
the Free Public License.

Modifications can be identified by comparing the master branch against
