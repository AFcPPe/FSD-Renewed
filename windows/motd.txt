Welcome to the first native FSD server for Windows.
All config files and logs are in Windows text format.
This fsd server can run as NT service, meaning it can
run on a PC even if no user is logged.
Additionally, network efficiency has been greatly
improved and can support up to 1024 users.
In futur, this FSD will include a embedded webserver to
provide native ServInfo service, a new weather engine,
and reporting in ODBC.


Enjoy
